The Chieftain had an irreconcilable difference of opinion with the king of Jaintiapur, the Erstwhile Jaintia Kingdom, which now constitutes the Jaintia district of Bangladesh. U Sajar Nangli knew that his differences with the king would inevitably lead to intensive combat causing a bloodbath of their own people and he was unwilling to be responsible for such a tragedy.

The lake is revered by the people of 'Raid Mukhla' who continue to offer sacrifice near the lake.
